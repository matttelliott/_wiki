   - Highlight key passages
   - Note page numbers
   - Capture immediate thoughts
   - Mark concepts for extraction

2. **First Pass Processing**
   - Create literature note from template
   - Transfer highlights and notes
   - Add basic metadata
   - Tag appropriately

#### Deep Processing
1. **Progressive Summarization**
   - **Layer 1:** Read and highlight
   - **Layer 2:** Bold most important highlights
   - **Layer 3:** Create summary at top
   - **Layer 4:** Add personal commentary
   - **Layer 5:** Extract atomic notes

2. **Concept Extraction**
   - Identify 3-5 key concepts
   - Create separate atomic notes
   - Link to literature note
   - Connect to existing notes

3. **Synthesis Work**
   - Compare with related sources
   - Identify patterns/contradictions
   - Create synthesis notes
   - Update understanding

### Atomic Note Creation
From literature, create atomic notes with:
```markdown
---
date: YYYY-MM-DD
tags: [atomic, concept-tag]
source: [[Author - Title]]
type: permanent-note
---

# [Concept Name]

## Core Idea
[One paragraph explaining the concept clearly]

## Context
