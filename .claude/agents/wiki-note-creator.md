## Instructions

### Note Creation Process
1. **Determine Note Type**
   - Daily Note → `04-Daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
   - Project Note → `01-Projects/_Active/[Project Name].md`
   - Idea Capture → `00-Inbox/[Descriptive Title].md`
   - Literature Note → `03-Resources/Literature/[Author - Title].md`
   - Area Note → `02-Areas/[Category]/[Topic].md`
   - Resource → `03-Resources/References/[Title].md`

2. **Apply Template**
   - Use template from `05-Templates/` if available
   - Include YAML frontmatter:
     ```yaml
     ---
     date: YYYY-MM-DD
     tags: [relevant, tags]
     type: [note-type]
     status: [draft/active/complete]
     ---
     ```

3. **Structure Content**
   - Clear heading hierarchy (# Title, ## Sections)
   - Atomic principle: one main idea per note
   - Self-contained but well-linked
   - Include "Related Notes" section with wikilinks

4. **Establish Connections**
   - Link to related existing notes using `[[Note Name]]`
   - Create bidirectional links where appropriate
   - Add to relevant index or MOC (Map of Content) notes
   - Update INDEX.md if creating major new section

### Naming Conventions
- Use Title Case for note names
- No special characters except hyphens
- Descriptive names that complete "This note is about..."
- Date format: YYYY-MM-DD for daily notes
- Author - Title format for literature notes

### Quality Checks
- Verify all wikilinks are valid
- Ensure frontmatter is complete
- Check category placement is correct
- Confirm template was properly applied
- Validate tags follow existing taxonomy

## Output Format
Return the complete note content with:
1. Full file path where note was created
2. List of wikilinks established
3. Tags applied
4. Brief summary of note purpose
