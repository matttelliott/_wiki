# AI-Centered Dotfiles: Modern Development Environment

## 🎯 Project Purpose
*Why am I doing this project? What problem does it solve?*

Create a comprehensive, AI-first dotfiles repository that establishes a consistent, powerful development environment across any Linux or macOS machine. This solves the problem of environment inconsistency, manual setup overhead, and the lack of AI tool integration in traditional development setups. The environment will be optimized for AI-assisted development workflows, particularly with Claude Code at its core.

## ✨ Desired Outcome
*What does "done" look like? How will I know when this project is complete?*

A fully automated, single-command installation dotfiles repository that creates an identical, AI-optimized development environment on any Unix-like system. The setup should take a fresh machine to a fully configured powerhouse in under 30 minutes, with all tools, configurations, and AI integrations ready to use.

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Single-command installation script that works on macOS and major Linux distributions
- [ ] Neovim configuration optimized for AI pair programming with Claude
- [ ] Tmux setup with AI-friendly layouts and session management
- [ ] Claude Code fully integrated with custom configurations and workflows
- [ ] Automated installation of all programming languages and their toolchains
- [ ] GUI application configurations managed programmatically
- [ ] AI tool suite installed and configured (Claude, GitHub Copilot, other LLM tools)
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation and onboarding guide
- [ ] Version-controlled and easily updatable across machines
- [ ] Disaster recovery and backup strategies implemented

## 📋 Project Planning

### Brainstorm
*All ideas, thoughts, and possibilities related to this project*

- Develop tmux layouts optimized for AI workflows
- Include shell aliases and functions for AI operations
- Create update mechanism for keeping all machines in sync
- Implement secret management for API keys
- Build health check system to verify installations
- Create bootstrap script that can run on minimal systems
- Include containerized development environments
- Add machine learning environment setup (Python, CUDA, etc.)

## 📝 Project Notes
*Meeting notes, research, decisions, and other project-related information*

### Key Decisions
- **Symlink Manager:** GNU Stow for simplicity and portability
- **Shell:** Zsh as primary with bash compatibility fallback
- **Plugin Manager:** Lazy.nvim for Neovim (modern and performant)
- **Installation Approach:** Modular with core/optional/experimental tiers
- **Configuration Format:** Lua for Neovim, YAML/TOML where appropriate
