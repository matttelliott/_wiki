# iPhone Pomodoro Timer: Finalization & Release

## üéØ Project Purpose
*Why am I doing this project? What problem does it solve?*

Complete and finalize a mostly-built Pomodoro timer app for iPhone that provides a focused, distraction-free productivity tool. The app addresses the need for a simple, effective time management solution that integrates well with the iOS ecosystem and personal workflow preferences.

## ‚ú® Desired Outcome
*What does "done" look like? How will I know when this project is complete?*

A fully functional, polished Pomodoro timer app that is either deployed to my personal device for private use or published on the App Store for public benefit. The app should be stable, feature-complete, and provide a delightful user experience that enhances productivity.

### Success Criteria
- [ ] All core Pomodoro features working flawlessly (timer, breaks, sessions)
- [ ] UI polished and responsive across all iPhone sizes
- [ ] Notifications and background operations functioning correctly
- [ ] Settings and customization options fully implemented
- [ ] Data persistence for session history and statistics
- [ ] App performance optimized (battery, memory, responsiveness)
- [ ] Decision made on distribution method (personal vs App Store)
- [ ] If App Store: submission requirements met and app published
- [ ] If personal: TestFlight or direct installation configured
