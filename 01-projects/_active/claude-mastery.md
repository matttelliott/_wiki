# Claude Mastery: Configuration, MCP, and Multi-Agent Workflows

## üéØ Project Purpose
*Why am I doing this project? What problem does it solve?*

Master Claude AI capabilities to create powerful, reusable configurations and workflows that enhance productivity across both technical development and personal knowledge management. This project aims to establish expert-level proficiency in Claude's advanced features, enabling efficient app development and sophisticated automation for various use cases.

## ‚ú® Desired Outcome
*What does "done" look like? How will I know when this project is complete?*

A comprehensive Claude ecosystem with production-ready configurations, custom agents, and MCP servers that can be leveraged for any project. The ability to rapidly prototype and build applications using Claude, while also using it effectively for non-coding projects like personal wiki management.

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Global Claude configuration established with optimized settings for various workflows
- [ ] Collection of reusable project templates with sane defaults for different project types
- [ ] Mastery of MCP (Model Context Protocol) with custom server implementations
- [ ] Working multi-agent orchestration system for complex tasks
- [ ] Library of custom hooks and workflows for common development patterns
- [ ] Demonstrated ability to build complete applications using Claude
- [ ] Efficient Claude-powered personal knowledge management system

## üìã Project Planning

### Brainstorm
*All ideas, thoughts, and possibilities related to this project*
- Create modular, composable Claude configurations
- Build MCP servers for common integrations (databases, APIs, local tools)
- Develop agent specialization patterns (architect, developer, reviewer, tester)
- Implement context management strategies for large codebases
- Create workflow automation for repetitive tasks
- Build Claude-powered development environment integrations
- Establish best practices documentation
- Create training materials and examples
- **Master voice-driven prompting as preferred interaction method** - Voice should be the primary way to interact with Claude for speed and natural communication, though text remains available when needed
- **Parallel multi-agent voice orchestration** - Develop ability to interact with multiple Claude agents simultaneously using voice commands, with intelligent routing to ensure the right commands reach the right agents with appropriate context

### Project Components
*Major pieces or phases of the project*

1. **Foundation Phase: Core Configuration**
   - Global Claude settings optimization
   - Project template creation
   - Basic hook implementation
   - Environment setup automation
   - Voice interaction setup and optimization (preferred input method)

2. **MCP Mastery Phase**
   - Understanding MCP architecture
   - Building custom MCP servers
   - Integration with existing tools
   - Performance optimization

3. **Multi-Agent Architecture Phase**
   - Agent role definition and specialization
   - Inter-agent communication patterns
   - Orchestration and coordination systems
   - Complex workflow implementation
   - **Voice-controlled multi-agent routing** - Build intelligent dispatcher that routes voice commands to appropriate agents based on context and intent
   - **Parallel agent execution** - Enable multiple agents to work simultaneously on different aspects of a task
   - **Context isolation and sharing** - Ensure each agent maintains its own context while sharing necessary information

4. **Application Development Phase**
   - Building sample applications with Claude
   - Establishing development patterns
   - Testing and debugging workflows
   - Performance and cost optimization

5. **Knowledge Management Integration**
   - Wiki automation workflows
   - Content generation pipelines
   - Research and analysis tools
   - Personal productivity enhancers

### Resources Needed
- **People:** Claude AI community, MCP documentation contributors, other developers using Claude
- **Tools:** Claude CLI, VS Code, GitHub, MCP SDK, various programming languages
- **Information:** Claude documentation, MCP specifications, best practices guides, community examples
- **Budget:** Claude API usage costs, potential infrastructure for MCP servers

### Constraints & Risks
- **Constraints:** API rate limits, token costs, Claude's context window limitations
- **Risks:** Rapid API changes, dependency on Anthropic's infrastructure, learning curve complexity
- **Dependencies:** Claude API availability, MCP ecosystem maturity, community tool development

## ‚úÖ Next Actions
*Immediate next physical actions to move this project forward*
- [ ] Audit current global Claude configuration and identify improvement areas #@computer
- [ ] Research and document MCP architecture and capabilities #@computer
- [ ] Create first custom MCP server for local file operations #@computer
- [ ] Design multi-agent workflow for code review process #@computer
- [ ] Set up project template repository with Claude configurations #@computer

## ‚è≥ Waiting For
*Items delegated or waiting on others*
- [ ] MCP SDK documentation updates from Anthropic
- [ ] Community feedback on best practices
- [ ] New Claude feature releases

## üìä Milestones
- [ ] **Milestone 1:** Complete global configuration and basic hooks - Target: Week 1-2
- [ ] **Milestone 2:** First working MCP server deployed - Target: Week 3-4
- [ ] **Milestone 3:** Multi-agent system prototype - Target: Week 5-6
- [ ] **Milestone 4:** First complete app built with Claude - Target: Week 7-8
- [ ] **Milestone 5:** Full wiki automation workflow - Target: Week 9-10

## üìù Project Notes
*Meeting notes, research, decisions, and other project-related information*

### Key Decisions
- Focus on reusability and modularity from the start
- Prioritize documentation and examples for future reference
- Build incrementally with working prototypes at each stage
- **Voice-first interaction philosophy** - Optimize for voice prompting as the primary interface, with text as fallback. Voice enables faster, more natural communication and reduces typing friction

### Technical Architecture Notes
- **Configuration Structure:** Hierarchical with global ‚Üí project ‚Üí task-specific overrides
- **MCP Server Types:** File system, database, API gateway, tool orchestrator
- **Agent Roles:** Architect, implementer, reviewer, tester, documenter, project manager
- **Hook Categories:** Pre-prompt, post-response, error handling, context management
- **Multi-Agent Voice Architecture:**
  - Voice input ‚Üí Intent classifier ‚Üí Agent router ‚Üí Parallel execution
  - Each agent maintains isolated context with shared memory pool
  - Voice feedback system to confirm routing and provide status updates
  - "Hey Claude, tell the architect to design the API while the developer starts on the frontend"
