# Personal Wiki System Evolution: GTD, Knowledge Management & AI Integration

## 🎯 Project Purpose
*Why am I doing this project? What problem does it solve?*

Transform this wiki from a static information repository into a dynamic, AI-enhanced personal operating system that actively supports daily productivity, knowledge capture, and personal growth. This solves the common problems of information fragmentation, inconsistent productivity habits, and the friction between capturing thoughts and taking action. The system should work seamlessly across all devices and integrate intelligently with daily workflows.

## ✨ Desired Outcome
*What does "done" look like? How will I know when this project is complete?*

A fully operational personal knowledge and productivity system that becomes an indispensable daily tool. The wiki should function as a second brain that captures everything, helps process and organize information, prompts action at the right time, and continuously learns and adapts to personal patterns. Success means never losing an idea, always knowing what to work on next, and having instant access to personal knowledge from any device.

### Success Criteria

## 📝 Project Notes
*Meeting notes, research, decisions, and other project-related information*

### Key Decisions
- **Sync Method:** Git-based for version control and conflict resolution
- **Mobile App:** Obsidian Mobile for full compatibility
- **AI Integration:** Claude agents via API for complex processing
- **Capture Philosophy:** Multiple methods, all leading to single inbox
- **Review Cadence:** Daily (5 min), Weekly (45 min), Monthly (2 hours)

### Implementation Strategy
1. Start with basic daily note habit
2. Add GTD lists incrementally
3. Introduce automation once manual process is solid
4. Expand to multiple devices after core workflow established
5. Add AI enhancements to reduce friction points
6. Continuously iterate based on actual usage patterns

### Habit Formation Plan
**Week 1-2:** Daily note only, focus on opening wiki each morning
**Week 3-4:** Add task capture during daily note
**Week 5-6:** Introduce weekly review
**Week 7-8:** Add quick capture from mobile
**Week 9+:** Refine and optimize based on patterns

*Initial project planning. Defined comprehensive approach to evolving wiki into full GTD + PKM system with AI automation. Focus on habit formation first, then systematic enhancement. Key insight: start simple, build habits, then add complexity.*

**Major Achievements Today:**
- ✅ Created comprehensive project documentation for 5 active projects
- ✅ Set up foundational context files for AI assistance (About Me, Technical Stack, Writing Style, Goals, Daily Routines, Coding Standards)
- ✅ Established git-based sync system working across macOS and iOS
- ✅ Created first daily note and started the habit
- ✅ Successfully tested sync from iPhone with multiple updates
- ✅ Built solid PARA structure with templates
