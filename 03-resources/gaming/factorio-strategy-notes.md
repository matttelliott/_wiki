## Build Order & Planning

### Early Game Strategy
- Keep starter bus on substation grid
- Start with 1-2-1 trains (simple and effective early setup)
- Advanced oil processing and bots BEFORE trains (automation first!)
- Build mall up and science down into available space (spatial planning)

## Base Layout Principles

## Production Ratios

## Train Systems

## Circuit Network Tricks

## Lessons Learned

## Factorio Issues & Annoyances
*Things that still need fixing after all these years*

### UI/UX Problems
- Can't sort pins
- New logistics groups appear at bottom of list instead of top
- No built-in blueprint editor
- Blueprints are items (why??)
- Filters keep setting but recipes don't persist same way

### Building Issues  
- No deconstruction tile option
- Need "force build" and "super force build" instead of intuitive "build around" and "build over"
- Can build outside radar range but can't cancel those ghosts
- Bots will deconstruct and immediately reconstruct same buildings
- Belts always default to the wrong direction

### Game Mechanic Issues
- Space platform "wait for inactivity" doesn't work properly
- Trains randomly disregard refuel schedules
- Landfill controls change mid-game when you unlock foundations
