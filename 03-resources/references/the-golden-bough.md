## Overview
"The Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion" by James George Frazer (1890-1915)
- Massive comparative study of mythology and religion across cultures
- 12 volumes in full edition, various one-volume abridgments available

## Core Concept: The Dying God
- Central thesis: Ancient cultures shared a "dying god" myth
- Divine figures who die and resurrect, tied to agricultural seasons
- Death at harvest, rebirth in spring
- Pattern supposedly found across all world mythologies

## Key Ideas
- Religion evolved from magic → religion → science
- Attempted to find universal patterns in human belief systems
- Priest-king Rex Nemorensis at Lake Nemi as starting point
- Ritual murder and succession as universal theme

## Cultural Impact
- Influenced modernist writers: James Joyce, T.S. Eliot, Ernest Hemingway
- Shaped Joseph Campbell's "Hero with a Thousand Faces"
- Foundational for early anthropology (now outdated)
- Controversial for including Christianity in comparative analysis

## Why It Matters
- Victorian attempt to find "source code" of all religions
- Example of 19th-century comparative method
- Still referenced in literature and cultural criticism
- Shows how scholars tried to systematize human belief

## The Title's Origin
From Virgil's Aeneid - golden branch grants passage to underworld
Metaphor: Frazer's book as guide through human beliefs

## Modern View
- Anthropologically outdated (overgeneralization, colonial perspective)
- Valuable as literature and intellectual history
- Shows evolution of how we study culture and religion
