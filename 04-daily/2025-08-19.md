## üìù Notes & Reflections

### System Issues to Resolve
- **iCloud sync not working**: The bidirectional sync between local (~/_wiki) and iCloud (~/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/Wiki) isn't running properly. Local sync is working fine with successful commits every 5 minutes, but the iCloud component of the bidirectional sync needs attention. Need to check if the iCloud repo is pulling/pushing correctly.
