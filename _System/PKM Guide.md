# Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) Guide

## 🧠 What is PKM?
Personal Knowledge Management is a system for capturing, organizing, processing, and using information to support learning, decision-making, and creative work.

## 🎯 Core Principles

### The Knowledge Cycle
1. **Capture** - Collect information and ideas
2. **Organize** - Structure and categorize
3. **Connect** - Link related concepts
4. **Create** - Generate new insights
5. **Review** - Refine and update

### The Three Types of Notes
1. **Fleeting Notes** - Quick captures, temporary
2. **Literature Notes** - From external sources
3. **Permanent Notes** - Your original thoughts

## 📝 Note-Taking Workflow

### Step 1: Capture Everything
Use [[05-Templates/Idea Capture|Idea Capture]] for:
- Shower thoughts
- Meeting insights  
- Article reactions
- Random connections
- Questions to explore

### Step 2: Process into Literature Notes
Use [[05-Templates/Literature Note|Literature Note]] for:
- Books you read
- Articles and papers
- Videos and podcasts
- Courses and lectures

### Step 3: Create Permanent Notes
Transform fleeting and literature notes into:
- Atomic ideas (one concept per note)
- Written in your own words
- Self-contained and understandable
- Linked to other notes

## 🔗 Linking Strategy

### Types of Links
- **Direct Links** - `[[Note Name]]` for explicit connections
- **Tags** - `#concept` for categorization
- **Mentions** - Unlinked references to discover later

### Linking Best Practices
1. Link liberally while writing
2. Create notes for concepts that don't exist yet
3. Use consistent naming conventions
4. Review orphaned notes regularly

### Maps of Content (MOCs)
Create index notes that link to related notes:
```markdown
# Programming MOCs
- [[JavaScript Fundamentals]]
- [[Python Best Practices]]
- [[Design Patterns]]
```

## 📚 The PARA Method
Organizing information by actionability:

### P - Projects
Things you're actively working on with deadlines
- Location: `01-Projects/`
- Timeframe: Days to months
- Example: "Launch new website"

### A - Areas
Ongoing responsibilities to maintain
- Location: `02-Areas/`
- Timeframe: Ongoing
- Example: "Health", "Finances", "Relationships"

### R - Resources
Things you want to reference in future
- Location: `03-Resources/`
- Timeframe: Indefinite
- Example: "Travel ideas", "Recipes", "Quotes"

### A - Archives
Inactive items from other categories
- Location: `03-Resources/Archives/`
- Timeframe: Past
- Example: Completed projects, old areas

## 🌱 Progressive Summarization

### Layer 1: Save
- Capture interesting content
- Save full articles/sources

### Layer 2: Bold
- **Bold** the most interesting passages
- Focus on surprising insights

### Layer 3: Highlight
- ==Highlight== the best of the bold
- Only the absolute essentials

### Layer 4: Summarize
- Write executive summary at top
- Add your own thoughts

### Layer 5: Create
- Turn into permanent note
- Add to your own work

## 💡 Zettelkasten Integration

### Principles
1. **One idea per note** - Keep notes atomic
2. **Complete thoughts** - Notes should stand alone
3. **Your own words** - Don't just copy-paste
4. **Permanent address** - Use consistent IDs/names
5. **Link everything** - Connect related ideas

### Note Structure
```markdown
# Note Title

Core idea in 1-2 sentences.

## Context
Why this matters or where it applies.

## Details
Expanded explanation with examples.

## Connections
- Relates to: [[Related Concept]]
- Contrasts with: [[Opposing Idea]]
- Examples: [[Case Study]]

## Questions
- What if...?
- How does this apply to...?
```

## 🔄 Review Cycles

### Daily (5 minutes)
- Process fleeting notes
- Review today's captures
- Create quick links

### Weekly (30 minutes)
- Process literature notes
- Create permanent notes
- Update MOCs

### Monthly (1 hour)
- Review note connections
- Identify patterns
- Consolidate similar notes

### Quarterly (2 hours)
- Audit note structure
- Archive outdated notes
- Refactor organization

## 🍎 Apple Ecosystem Integration

### Quick Capture on iOS
1. Use Shortcuts app for templates
2. Share sheet → Obsidian
3. Voice memos → Transcribe later
4. Screenshots → Process in review

### Cross-Device Workflow
1. Capture on iPhone (quick notes)
2. Process on iPad (reading/annotating)
3. Create on Mac (writing/linking)
4. Review everywhere

## 📊 Metadata Standards

### Frontmatter Template
```yaml
---
created: 2024-01-15
modified: 2024-01-15
type: [permanent/literature/fleeting]
tags: []
aliases: []
status: [draft/in-progress/complete]
---
```

### Tag Taxonomy
- `#concept/` - Abstract ideas
- `#project/` - Project-related
- `#area/` - Area of responsibility
- `#source/` - Source types
- `#status/` - Note status
