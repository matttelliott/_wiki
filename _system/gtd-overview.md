# GTD (Getting Things Done) System Overview

## üéØ Core Principles

### The Five Steps
1. **Capture** - Collect everything that has your attention
2. **Clarify** - Process what it means and what to do about it
3. **Organize** - Put things where they belong
4. **Reflect** - Review frequently to stay current
5. **Engage** - Use your system to take action with confidence

## üì• Capture
Everything goes into the inbox first. No exceptions.

### Capture Tools
- **Obsidian Inbox:** [[00-Inbox]] folder
- **Apple Reminders:** Quick capture on iPhone/Mac
- **Physical Inbox:** For papers, mail, business cards
- **Voice Memos:** Transcribe into inbox later

### Capture Triggers
- Ideas and inspirations
- Commitments made to others
- Projects and tasks
- Reference materials
- Someday/maybe items

## üîç Clarify
Process inbox items with these questions:

### The Clarifying Questions
1. **What is it?**
2. **Is it actionable?**
   - **NO** ‚Üí Trash, Reference, or Someday/Maybe
   - **YES** ‚Üí Continue...
3. **What's the next action?**
4. **Will it take less than 2 minutes?**
   - **YES** ‚Üí Do it now
   - **NO** ‚Üí Defer or delegate
5. **Is it a project?** (requires more than one action)
   - **YES** ‚Üí Create project in [[01-Projects]]
   - **NO** ‚Üí Single action task

## üóÇ Organize

### Organization Structure
```
00-Inbox/          ‚Üê Everything starts here
01-Projects/       ‚Üê Multi-step outcomes
  _Active/         ‚Üê Current projects
  _Completed/      ‚Üê Finished projects
02-Areas/          ‚Üê Ongoing responsibilities  
03-Resources/      ‚Üê Reference materials
04-Daily/          ‚Üê Daily notes and logs
```

### Lists to Maintain
- **Next Actions** - Organized by context (#@home, #@work, etc.)
- **Projects** - Anything requiring multiple actions
- **Waiting For** - Items delegated or pending
- **Someday/Maybe** - Ideas for the future
- **Reference** - Information to keep

### Task Format
```markdown
- [ ] Task description #@context ^due(YYYY-MM-DD) !priority
```

Examples:
- `- [ ] Call dentist to schedule cleaning #@phone ^due(2024-01-15) !high`
- `- [ ] Review [[Q1 Budget]] proposal #@computer ^due(2024-01-20) !medium`
- `- [ ] Buy milk #@errands !low`

## üìÖ Reflect

### Daily Review (5 minutes)
- Check calendar
- Review next actions
- Process any captures

### [[05-Templates/Weekly Review|Weekly Review]] (90 minutes)
Every week, typically Sunday:
1. Get Clear - Process all inboxes
2. Get Current - Update all lists
3. Get Creative - Think about new projects

### Monthly Review (2 hours)
- Review Areas of Focus
- Update project priorities
- Clean up reference files

## ‚ö° Engage

### Choosing What to Do
Consider these four criteria:
1. **Context** - What can I do where I am?
2. **Time Available** - How much time do I have?
3. **Energy Available** - How much energy do I have?
4. **Priority** - What's most important?

### The Six Horizons
- **Ground:** Current actions
- **Horizon 1:** Current projects (1 week - 3 months)
- **Horizon 2:** Areas of focus and accountability
- **Horizon 3:** Goals (1-2 years)
- **Horizon 4:** Vision (3-5 years)
- **Horizon 5:** Purpose and principles

## üè∑ Contexts in This System

### Location-Based
- `#@home` - Tasks to do at home
- `#@work` - Tasks for work/office
- `#@errands` - Out and about

### Tool-Based
- `#@computer` - Requires computer
- `#@phone` - Phone calls and mobile tasks
- `#@online` - Requires internet

### Energy-Based
- `#@high-energy` - Requires focus and energy
- `#@low-energy` - Can do when tired

### Time-Based
- `#@quick` - Less than 15 minutes
- `#@deep-work` - Requires extended focus

## üçé Apple Integration
